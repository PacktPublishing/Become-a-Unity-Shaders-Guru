## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Compute Assets/CH07/FillWithRed")]
public class ComputeFillWithRed : URPComputeAsset {
    public override void Render(CommandBuffer commandBuffer,
        int kernelHandle) {}
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for technical artists who have worked with Unity and want to get a deeper understanding of Unity's render pipelines and its visual node-based editing tool. Seasoned game developers who are looking for reference shaders using the recent URP render pipeline will also find this book useful. A basic level of programming experience in HLSL, Unity, its layout, and its basic usage is a must.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
### Software and Hardware List
